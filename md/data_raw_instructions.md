The **Raw data** panel displays the input data and associated
validation summaries (once the data have been loaded - that is, once
Stage 2 has been complete). The table (main metadata table) above
initially has a row for each of the input files.

The title of each input file name is displayed in the first column
(**File**). The size and file creation time in the next two columns
(fields). The **Status** field indicates whether the data in the
various files are considered valid (<span class="fas
fa-circle-check"></span>) or not (<span class="fas
fa-circle-xmark"></span>).

Clicking anywhere in a row containing will select the row and once a
row is selected, information in both the _Data_ and _Validation
issues_ tabs will be populated.

Initially, the _Instructions_ tab will be active and visible
(providing these instructions).  The other two tabs are:

- **Data**: provides a view of the data beyind the selected row in the
  main metadata table and a mechanism to download those data. Only the
  first 10 rows are displayed in the table, the others being
  accessable via the controls under the table.

  Note, all numerical values are displayed only to three decimal
  places, yet the actual underlying data is full resolution.

- **Validation issues**: highlights and displays a description any
  validation issues associated with the selected row in the main
  metadata table.

  If there were no validation issues, this table will be empty.
  Otherwise, the description field will indicate the nature of the
  violation and in the case of issues with an individual record, the
  offending row will be presented across the remaining cells in the
  row. For more information about the validation tests, please refer
  to the **Data requirements** box (to the right of this box in the
  app).

Underneath both the Data and Validation tables, there is a **Download
as csv** button. Via this button, you can download a comma separated
text file version of the data in the table for further review in a
spreadsheet of your choice. Once you click this button, you will be
prompted to navigate to a suitable location to store the file.
