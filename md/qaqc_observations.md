This page displays multi-panel figures depicting the observed data for
a selected year conditional on Measures (columns) and Zones (rows).
These figures at organised according to three _Source_ types (all, CFM
and Discrete) and these are activated via three large tab buttons down
the left side of the panel. The sampling year is selected via a
dropdown box in a panel above the figures.

The individual figures depict the observed Measures (columns) of all
Water Quality data from each of eleven Zones (rows). The red vertical
line indicates associated Water Quality Guideline value. The
transparent red band indicates a range of values represented by half
and twice the guideline value (equivalent to the Scaled Modified
Amplitude index capping domain). The blue band represents the
Guideline range for Dissolved Oxygen. Note, the y-axis only represents
jittered and unordered space. temporal sampling design.
