To run this tool, please adhere to the following steps:

1. review the _Path Settings_ (specifically checking the **"Data input dir"**)
   and ensuring that there is at least one data file listed in the box
   under this setting
2. review the _Run Settings_. In particular,
   - consider whether you need to **Clear the previous data** -
     clicking the button to do so. Clearing the previous data deletes
     all cache and ensure that the analyses are performed fresh.
     **This is recommended whenever the input data changes**. Not
     clearing the previous data allows the user to skip directly to
     later run stages if earlier stages have already been run.
3. navigate the _Dashboard_ via the menu on the left sidebar

In the _Run settings_ panel, there is a **Run in sequence** toggle. By
default, this toggle is set to "Yes" which ensures that all stages
must be run in sequence and the various pages will become active once
the appropriate stages have been complete. Toggling this switch to
"NO" will instantly make all side menus, pages and run buttons become
available. The purpose of this is to allow the user to re-visit the
outcomes of analyses without the need to completely re-run the entire
analysis. This is particularly useful if the user is returning to the
analyses at a later date.

<div class="callout call-info"><h4>Note</h4> 
Toggling the **Run in
sequence** switch to "No" assumes that numerous artifacts (data saved throughtout the analysis process) are available and thus should only be considered after the analyses
have been run through completely at some time.  Never toggle this switch straight after
clicking the "Clear previous data" button.
